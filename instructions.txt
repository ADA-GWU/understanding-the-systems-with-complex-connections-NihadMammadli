This project uses socket and pyqt5 libraries mainly.
Socket library is used for both client and server app while pyqt5 library will help us to create windows and manipulate with design

How to run the server/client app(s) ? 

Two ways:

    First way:
    -- Clone repository
    -- Install needed libraries
        -- pip install PyQt5

        ######################
        pip install python-socketio (not in this version)
        ######################
    -- Open the codes in your favourite code editor
    -- Run source_code/server_app/server.py 3 or more times 
    -- Run source_code/client_app/client.py 
    -- See the results



    Second Way: 
    -- Clone repository
    -- Open apps
    -- Choose your OS Windows/Linux
    -- After chosing your OS just run the server and client apps
    -- That's it enjoy the result
    
    
-- In both ways you need to write the secret_key for the server app 
-- In both ways you need to write the ip address (or localhost, 127.0.0.1) and start and end port in client app 

P.S 
-- As I couldn't find any mac I couldn't test it for mac
-- For creating one-click app for mac only thing you need to do is:
    -- pip install pyinstaller
    -- echo $PATH
    -- pyinstaller --onefile $LOCATION_OF_CLIENT.PY 
    -- pyinstaller --onefile $LOCATION_OF_SERVER.PY
    -- Or just use the source_code



Thank you !
