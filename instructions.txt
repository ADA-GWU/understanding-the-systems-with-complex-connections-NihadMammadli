This project uses python-socketio and pyqt5 libraries mainly.
Socketio library is used for both client and server app while pyqt5 library will help us to create windows and manipulate with design

How to run the server/client app(s) ? 

Two ways:

    First way:
    -- Clone repository
    -- Install needed libraries
    -- Run server/main.py 3 or more times 
    -- Run client/main.py

    Second Way: 
    -- Clone repository
    -- Open apps
    -- Choose your OS Windows/Linux/Mac
    -- After chosing your OS just run the server and client apps
    -- That's it enjoy the result
